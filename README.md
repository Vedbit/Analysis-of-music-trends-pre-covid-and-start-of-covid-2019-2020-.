Just wanted to see if there was a statistically significant change between 2019 and 2020 in the positivity of music, because 2020 was considered a tough year for most.
I could have better made the project by finding the mean of more years instead of just 2019 for example 2010-2019 getting the mean
and compairing it to the valence of 2020.
