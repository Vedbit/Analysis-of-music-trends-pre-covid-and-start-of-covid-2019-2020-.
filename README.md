Just wanted to see if there was a statistically significant change between 2019 and 2020 in the positivity of music(valence), because 2020 was considered a tough year for most people.

In the end I probably could have better made the project by finding the mean of many years of valence instead of just 2019 for example 2010-2019 getting the mean
and compairing it to the valence of 2020. Would better show if there was a change in any meaningful direction. All my project does is it shows a change between the music listening trends of 2019 and 2020.
